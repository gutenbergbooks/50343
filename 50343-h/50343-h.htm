The information in this chapter is taken from the following:

(Arnold, London, 1912) V. i, ch. 13
<br />
<i>Cambridge History of English Literature</i> (Cambridge, 1916)

<p>People love to be shocked! That explains the
present circulation of <i>Life</i>. It explains, too, the clamor with
which Edinburgh received the October number of <i>Blackwood’s
Edinburgh Magazine</i> in 1817. For the first time in periodical
history, the reading public was actually thrilled and completely
shocked! Edinburgh held up its hands in horror, looked pious,
wagged its head&mdash;and bought up every number! It is a strange
parallel, perhaps, <i>Life</i> and <i>Blackwood’s</i>,&mdash;yet not so strange.
It is hard at first glance to understand how those yellow,
musty old pages could have been so shocking which now seem to
have lost all savor for the man in the street. But before we
can appreciate just how shocking <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> was, or
why, it will be necessary first to remember the Edinburgh of
those days, and the men who thought and fought in those pages,
and the then state of periodical literature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>When we call <i>Blackwood’s</i> the first <i>real</i> magazine it
is by virtue of worth, not fact. There were numerous periodicals
preceding and contemporary with it. Most of them have never
been heard of by the average citizen, and no doubt oblivion is
the kindest shroud to fold them in. The <i>Monthly Review</i>, founded
in 1749, was the oldest. It ran till 1845 and is remembered
chiefly for the fact that it had decided Whiggish leanings
with a touch of the Nonconformist. <i>The Critical Review</i>, a Tory
organ, ran from 1756 to 1817, the natal year of “Maga”, as
<i>Blackwood’s</i> was fondly dubbed. <i>The British Critic</i>, 1793-1843,
was a mouthpiece for High Church opinion; and <i>The Christian
Observer</i>, 1802-1857, served the same purpose for the evangelicals.
<i>The Anti-Jacobin</i>, 1797-98, was almost the only journal of the
time where talent or wit appeared often enough not to be accidental,
and it ran only eight months. <i>The Gentleman’s Magazine</i>,
1731-1868, has come in for a small share of immortality, but
could never aspire to be considered a “moulder of opinion”. It
published good prose and verse, and articles of antiquarian and
literary tone; its scholarship was fair. When this is said,
all is said.</p>

<p><i>The Edinburgh Review</i> and <i>The Quarterly</i> are the
only two besides <i>Blackwood’s</i> which come down to the Twentieth
Century with any degree of lasting fame. In 1755 had appeared
the first <i>Edinburgh Review</i> “to be published every six months”.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
It survived only two numbers, being too radical and self-sufficient
in certain philosophical and religious views for that day of
orthodoxy. In October 1802 the first number of the <i>Edinburgh
Review and Critical Journal</i>, a quarterly, appeared, which according
to the advertisement in the first number was to be “distinguished
for the selection rather than for the number of its
articles”.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Its aim was to enlighten and guide the public mind
in the paths of literature, art, science, politics,&mdash;with perhaps
a bit of emphasis on the words <i>guide</i> and <i>politics</i>. Francis
Jeffrey, of whom Lockhart, later one of the leading lights of
<i>Blackwood’s</i>, says, “It is impossible to conceive the existence
of a more fertile, teeming intellect”,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> was the first editor
and remained so until 1829. In the first number, October 1802,
there were twenty-nine articles, contributed by Sydney Smith,
Jeffrey, Francis Horner, Brougham, and Thomson, Murray and Hamilton.
During its first three years the <i>Review</i> distinguished
itself by adding such names to its list as Walter Scott, Playfair,
John Allen, George Ellis, and Henry Hallam. With such pens
supporting it, it would have been strange if it had not been
readable. There was indeed an air of vitality and energy throughout,
which distinguished it from any of its forerunners; it spoke
as one having authority; and men turned as instinctively to
Francis Jeffrey and the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for final verdicts, as
it never entered their heads to seriously consider the <i>Gentleman’s
Magazine</i> or even the <i>Quarterly</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>This first number, October 1802, is as representative
as any. Jeffrey wrote the first article, reviewing a book
on the causes of the revolution by Mounier, late president of
the French National Assembly. There was an article by Francis
Horner on “The Paper Credit of Great Britain”; one by Brougham
on “The Crisis in the Sugar Colonies”. Another by Jeffrey, a
criticism of Southey’s “Thalaba”, indicates the young editor’s
intention to live up to the motto of the <i>Review</i>:&mdash;“<i>Judex damnatur
cum nocens absolvitur</i>&mdash;The Judge is damned when the offender is
freed”. With Jeffrey anything new in the world of letters was
taboo, and Southey he considered “a champion and apostle” of a
school of poetry which was nothing if not new. Quoting him:
“Southey is the first of these brought before us for judgment,
and we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously
without pronouncing a few words upon the nature and tendency of
the tenets he has helped to propagate”.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Notice that Jeffrey
uses the term “inquisitorial office”, therein pleading guilty to
the very attitude of which Lockhart accused him, and in opposition
to which in <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> he later took such a decided
stand, offending how similarly, we are later to discover.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a>

<p>Lockhart admired Jeffrey and praised his talents; it
was the use to which he put those talents that Lockhart assailed.
The following words of Lockhart’s own, even though tinged with
that exaggerated vindictiveness so characteristic of him, give

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
a pretty fair idea of the attitude he and all the Blackwood
group took against Jeffrey and the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>; and shows
the spirit underlying the rivalry that took root before ever
<i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i> existed and prevailed for ever after.
“Endowed by nature with a keen talent for sarcasm (Jeffrey, that
is) nothing could be more easy for him than to fasten, with the
destructive effect of nonchalance upon a work which had perhaps
been composed with much earnestness of thought on the part of
the author.... The object of the critic, however, is by no
means to assist those who read his critical lucubrations, to
enter with more facility, or with better preparation into the
thoughts or feelings or truths which his author endeavors to
inculcate or illustrate. His object is merely to make the author
look foolish; and he prostitutes his own fine talents, to enable
the common herd”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>&mdash;to look down upon the deluded author who is
victim of the <i>Review</i>. This is what Lockhart considered Jeffrey
to be doing, and he was not alone in his opinion. It is to be
remembered, however, that Lockhart’s attitude was always more
tense, keener, and a little more bitter than others’, yet his
words better than any one else’s sound the keynote of the
deadly opposition to the <i>Review</i> which “Maga” assumed from the
first. Quoting him again, "<i>The Edinburgh Review</i> cared very
little for what might be done, or might be hoped to be done,
provided it could exercise a despotic authority in deciding on

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the merits of what <i>was</i> done. Nobody could ever regard this
work as a great fostering-mother of the infant manifestations
of intellectual and imaginative power. It was always sufficiently
plain, that in all things its chief object was to support
the credit of its own appearance. It praised only where praise
was extorted&mdash;and it never praised even the highest efforts of
contemporary genius in the spirit of true and genuine earnestness
which might have been becoming”.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Lockhart never quite forgave
Jeffrey for failing instantly to recognize the genius of Wordsworth.
He continues, of the Reviewers: “They never spoke out
of the fulness of the heart in praising any one of our great
living poets, the majesty of whose genius would have been quite
enough to take away all ideas except those of prostrate respect”.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
Taking all of Lockhart’s impetuosity with a pinch of salt, the
fact remains undeniably true that the <i>Edinburgh</i> assumed the
patronizing air of bestowing rather than recognizing honor when
it praised.</p>

<p>Among the builders of the <i>Edinburgh</i> Henry Brougham
stands one of the foremost. In five years he contributed as
many as eighty articles, an average of four each number, and it
is said that he once wrote an entire number. He was capable of
it! Brougham was a powerful politician, but unfortunately did
not limit his contributions to political subjects. He wrote
scientific, legal and literary papers as well, with the air of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
one whose mandates go undisputed. Undisputed they did go,
too. In fact Brougham just escaped being a genius! He made a
big splash in his own little world and age, but his fame has
not outlived him. Another prominent contributor was Sydney
Smith, a man of no small reputation as a humorist. He earnestly
applied his talents to the forwarding of serious causes, and
talents undoubtedly he had; but the wit of his style, according
to the Hon. Arthur R. D. Elliot, erstwhile editor of the <i>Review</i>,
its cleverness and jollity, prevented many from recognizing the
genuine sincerity of his character.</p>

<p>By the end of 1806, Sir Walter Scott had contributed
twelve articles in all, among them papers on Ellis’s “Early
English Poets”, on Godwin’s “Life of Chaucer”, on Chatterton’s
“Works”, on Froissart’s “Chronicles”. After 1806, he withdrew
from the <i>Review</i>, and politics became the more prominent feature.
No account of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> has ever been given, written
or told without including a remark of Jeffrey’s to Sir Walter
Scott in a letter about this time. It would never do to omit it
here! The remark is this: “The <i>Review</i>, in short, has but two
legs to stand on. Literature, no doubt, is one of them: but
its <i>Right Leg</i> is Politics.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Scott’s ideal was to keep it literary;
and his break was on account of its excessive Whiggism.
In Jeffrey’s mind, however, <i>The Edinburgh Review</i> was destined

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
to save the nation! He championed the causes of Catholic
emancipation, of popular education, prison reform, even some
small degree of justice in Ireland, et cetera, all flavored, of
course, with the saving grace of Whiggism.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">9</a>
Elton: <i>A Survey of English Literature, 1780-1830</i>. V. i, p. 387</p></div>

<p>Modern critics more than once have characterized
Jeffrey as that “once-noted despot of letters”. But it is not
fair only to be told that Jeffrey once said of Wordsworth’s
Excursion, “This will never do!” That he considered the end of
The Ode to Duty “utterly without meaning”; and that the Ode on
Intimations of Immortality was “unintelligible”; that he ignored
Shelley, and committed other like unpardonable sins. Those things
are true and known and by them is he judged, but they are not <i>all</i>
by which he should be judged by any means! There is no doubt
in the world but what Jeffrey’s mind was cast in a superior
mould. Lockhart himself has already testified there could not
be “a more fertile, teeming intellect”. He was seldom, if ever,
profound, we admit; but even the most grudging critic must grant
him that large, speculative understanding and shrewd scrutiny so
prominent in his compositions. Imagination, fancy, wit, sarcasm
were his own, but not the warm and saving quality of humor. He
was a great man and a brilliant criticiser, though hardly a great
critic. The great critic is the true prophet and Jeffrey was no
prophet. As late as 1829 in an article on Mrs. Hemans in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>, he wrote: “Since the beginning of our critical
career we have seen a vast deal of beautiful poetry pass into
oblivion in spite of our feeble efforts to recall or retain it

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
in remembrance. The tuneful quartos of Southey are already
little better than lumber:&mdash;and the rich melodies of Keats
and Shelley,&mdash;and the fantastical emphasis of Wordsworth,&mdash;and
the plebeian pathos of Crabbe,&mdash;are melting fast from the
field of our vision. The novels of Scott have put out his
poetry. Even the splendid strains of Moore are fading into
distance and dimness, except where they have been married to
immortal music; and the blazing star of Byron himself is receding
from its place of pride.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Herein he only redeems himself
from his early condemnation of Wordsworth and Shelley and
Southey, to damn himself irrevocably in our eyes again with his
amazing lack of foresight! No! Jeffrey was no prophet. He
had not the range of vision of the true critic, and “where
there is no vision the people perish”. This was indeed an
epitaph written a century ago for a grave not even yet in view.
It must not be hastily concluded from this, however, that all
the criticism in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was poor stuff. A vast
amount of it was splendid work; the best output of the best
minds of the time; and it was the one and only authentic and
readable journal for years. This is corroborated by a statement
of Sir Walter Scott’s in a letter to George Ellis: “No genteel
family can pretend to be without the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>; because,
independent of its politics, it gives the only valuable literary
criticisms that can be met with.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>But it was high time for a new periodical of
opposite politics and fresh outlook; and in 1809 Gifford was
established as editor of <i>The Quarterly Review</i>. Its four
pillars were politics, literature, scholarship, and science;
but its main purpose was to oppose the <i>Edinburgh</i> and create
an intellectual nucleus for the rallying of the Tories. In
October 1808 after plans were well on foot, Scott wrote to
Gifford, prospective editor: “The real reason for instituting
the new publication is the disgusting and deleterious doctrines
with which the most popular of our Reviews disgraces its pages.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
This of course was a reference to the political policies of
the <i>Edinburgh</i>, yet the tone of the <i>Quarterly</i> was not to be one
of political opposition only. Scott was eager for the success
of the first number and wrote nearly a third of it himself.
Later he busied himself to enlist the services of Southey and
Rogers and Moore and Kirkpatrick Sharpe as contributors. Southey
wrote altogether about one hundred articles on subjects varying
from Lord Nelson to the Poor Laws. Scott himself contributed
about thirty with his usual versatility of subject matter, all
the way from fly fishing to Pepys’ Diary. In the issue for
January 1817 he even reviewed “Tales of my Landlord” and “ventured
to attribute them to the author of Waverley and Guy
Mannering.”! John Wilson Croker, satirist, was another prominent

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
contributor, narrow of mind and heart, intolerant of soul.
He was an accurate and able “argu-fier” however, and one of
the ruling genii in the politics of the <i>Quarterly</i>. In forty-five
years he contributed something like two hundred and fifty-eight
articles. Sir John Barrow, traveller and South African
statesman, contributed much and copiously, multitudinous
reviews and voyages, all in his unvarying “solid food” style
and tone. Hallam and Sharon Turner wrote historical papers;
Ugo Fosculo wrote on Italian classics. Such was the tone of
the <i>Quarterly</i>. It took itself seriously, and was evidently
always taken seriously. But no modern would consider those
dim old pages of criticism as a criterion to the literature of
that age. It was too heavy to be sensitive to new excellencies,
too intent on upholding failing causes to recognize new ones.
In truth, it was a periodical strangely unresponsive to artistic
or literary excellence or attainment. By 1818 and 1819 its
circulation was almost 14,000&mdash;practically the same as the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>; but the <i>Quarterly</i> never made the stir the
<i>Edinburgh</i> did. Ellis spoke truth when he pronounced it, “Though
profound, notoriously and unequivocally dull”.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Gifford
remained editor until 1824; then John Taylor Coleridge ascended
the throne for two years, and after that, Lockhart.</p>

work.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> An occasional contribution by Hazlitt or Reynolds
enlivened it a bit, but only served to emphasize in contrast
the duller parts.</p>

<p>The name of Leigh Hunt can scarcely be omitted from
this panorama, though here it is the journalist rather than the
journal which attracts attention. At various times he edited
various publications, ten in all, and all of them more or less
short-lived and unsuccessful. Among them was the <i>Reflector</i>
(1810-11), a quarterly which is remembered mainly because
Hunt was its editor and Charles Lamb one of its contributors.
Most noteworthy of his periodical projects was the <i>Examiner</i>,
a newspaper which he began to edit (1808) for his brother, and
continued to do so for the space of some thirteen years. It
professed no political allegiance, but was enough outspoken in
its radical views to land both Leigh Hunt and his brother in
prison, after printing an article on the Prince Regent. Among
other things of interest, it started a department of theatrical
criticism; and on the whole, with men like Hazlitt and Lamb
contributing, it could not escape being interesting. The
Blackwood group later reacted to it and its editor as a bull
does to a red rag, testifying at least that it was far from
nondescript.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<p>The <i>London Magazine</i> did not start until two years
after <i>Blackwood’s</i>, and we will dismiss it with only a few words.
It was a periodical fashioned after the sprightlier manner
which <i>Blackwood’s</i>, too, strove to maintain. They were bitter
rivals from the first; and as to which was the more bitter, the
more stinging in its personalities, it would be hard to judge.
At one time matters even reached such a pitch that John Scott,
the <i>London’s</i> first editor, and Lockhart found it necessary to
“meet on the sod”. The <i>London</i> put forth many fine things. In
September 1821 it gave to the public “Confessions of an Opium
Eater” by a certain Thomas De Quincey. A year later it offered
“A Dissertation on Roast Pig” by an author then not so well
known as now. A poem or two of one John Keats appeared in its
pages; and when all is said, there is no doubt that the <i>London
Magazine</i> did at times splendidly illumine the poetry of the
age. It ran from 1820 to 1829.</p>

<p>Thus in brief was the periodical world. The quarterly
reviews were avowedly pretentious, never amusing, not creative.
Contents were limited to political articles, to pompous dissertations
and reviews. There were no stories, no verse, nothing
unbending, never a touch of fantasy. Their political flavor
was the least of their sins. A touch of the Radical, the Whig
or the Tory is a real contribution to the history of literature,
wherein it inevitably involves great historic divisions of the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
thought of a nation concerning life and art. No. Our quarrel,
like <i>Blackwood’s</i>, is on the ground of their rigidity. It is
well to hold fast that which is good; but it is not well to
insistently oppose and blind oneself and others to the changing
order and the forward march of men and letters.</p>

<p>Knowing what we do of Jeffrey and the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> it is easy to comprehend what prompted Lockhart’s pen
to say: “It is, indeed, a very deplorable thing to observe in
what an absurd state of ignorance the majority of educated
people in Scotland have been persuaded to keep themselves, concerning
much of the best and truest literature of their own
age, as well as of the ages that have gone by”.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>... His
quarrel is ours for the nonce, and to comprehend the spirit of
“Maga” it is first necessary to comprehend the spirit which
prompted much for which it is so rigorously criticised. Lockhart
speaks of the “facetious and rejoicing ignorance” of the
Reviewers. “I do not on my conscience believe”, says he in
Peter’s Letters, “that there is one Whig in Edinburgh to whom
the name of my friend Charles Lamb would convey any distinct or
definite idea.... They do not know even the names of some
of the finest poems our age has produced. They never heard of
<i>Ruth</i> or <i>Michael</i>, or <i>The Brothers</i> or <i>Hartleap Well</i>, or the <i>Recollections
of Infancy</i> or the <i>Sonnets to Buonaparte</i>. They do not
know that there is such a thing as the description of a churchyard

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
in <i>The Excursion</i>. Alas! how severely is their ignorance
punished in itself”!<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Perhaps we can forgive the egotistic
note in the following words, also from Peter’s Letters:
“There is no work which has done so much to weaken the authority
of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> in such matters as <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
<i>Blackwood’s</i> is at least still readable which is more than can
be said of most of its contemporaries. Though it did not, like
the <i>London</i>, discover a Charles Lamb or a De Quincey, it did and
does still overflow with the forging energy and ardent enthusiasms
of youth. Besides the famous “Noctes Ambrosianae” for the most
part attributed to John Wilson, it published good short stories,
good papers by James Hogg, John Galt, and others, good verse,
much generous as well as much vindictive criticism. It opened
up new fields of interest: German, Italian and Norse letters, all
hitherto but slightly touched upon. But we anticipate,&mdash;and
must needs begin at the beginning.</p>

<i>Genesis</i></h2>

<p>We are told that William Blackwood grew impatient
of “humdrum bookselling”, and considering the spirited character
of the man, it is easy to believe. That hardly explains the
whole truth concerning the origin of “Maga”, however. The history
of <i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i> might almost be considered the
history of the struggle between two rival booksellers, Mr. Constable
and William Blackwood. The personality of the man William
Blackwood is no less interesting than the personality of his magazine,
and indeed, his was the spirit which colored the periodical
from start to finish. His energy and acumen were of the sort
which leave their mark on all they touch. To know William Blackwood
means to see his vigorous, unwearying figure through and behind
every page. Lockhart knew him as well as any, and it is his
able portraiture that follows: “He is a nimble active-looking man
of middle-age, and moves about from one corner to another with
great alacrity, and apparently under the influence of high animal
spirits. His complexion is very sanguineous, but nothing can be
more intelligent, keen and sagacious than the expression of the
whole physiognomy, above all, the grey eyes and eyebrows as
full of locomotion as those of Catalini. The remarks he makes
are in general extremely acute.... The shrewdness and decision of
the man can, however, stand in need of no testimony beyond what
his own conduct has afforded&mdash;above all, in the establishment

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of his Magazine,&mdash;(the conception of which I am convinced was
entirely his own), and the subsequent energy with which he has
supported it through every variety of good and evil fortune.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
Lockhart was in a position to know the true character of the
man, for these words were written two years after his own first
connection with William Blackwood and his periodical. Again, he
describes the publisher as “a man of strong talents, and though
without anything that could be called learning, of very respectable
information, ... acute, earnest, eminently zealous in
whatever he put his hand to; upright, honest, sincere and courageous”.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
This was William Blackwood, and it is small wonder such
a man should grow weary of “humdrum bookselling”.</p>

<p><i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i> was the result of
more stringent stimuli, however, than the restlessness of its
founder. It was necessary that the sentiments of those opposed
to Jeffrey and the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> should have a medium of
expression. Blackwood considered the <i>Quarterly</i> “too ponderous,
too sober, dignified and middle-aged”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> to frustrate the influence
of the <i>Edinburgh</i>. It was not stimulating, in other words, and the
present day agrees with him. His ideal was a magazine “more
nimble, more frequent, more familiar”. But not least among the
many stirrings of mind and brain which gave rise to “Maga” was
Blackwood’s disappointment over the loss of the Waverley series.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
The honesty and courage of the man need no other evidence
than the fact that he criticised “The Black Dwarf” and even
suggested a different ending. Scott, of course, would have none
of his meddling, and transferred his future dealings to Constable,
publisher of the despised <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, and the <i>Scots Magazine</i>,
which was at that moment more or less insignificant. It
is evident that Blackwood did not take pains to seek out any
specious circumlocution in his criticism, and the idea that any
man should criticise the Great Wizard of the North brings a
catch to the breath and a tingling down one’s spinal column!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a>
Mrs. Oliphant: <i>Annals of a Publishing House</i>, V. i, p. 97</p></div>

<p>There is no doubt that the politics, the conceit,
the unappreciative and at times irreligious tone of the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> were the main reasons for the bitter hatred of the
<i>Blackwood</i> writers; but there is less doubt that thus to lose
the Waverley series was a last incendiary straw to William Blackwood.
He immediately set about putting in action the plans
which had been smouldering so long.</p>

<p>In April 1817 appeared the first number of <i>Blackwood’s
Edinburgh Magazine</i>. There seems to be a general understanding
among bibliographers that the first numbers were known
as the “Edinburgh Monthly Magazine”. According to the old
volumes themselves, however, only the second number, the
issue for May 1817, went by this title, the initial number and
all the rest bearing the heading, <i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i>.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
Messrs. Pringle and Cleghorn were the first joint
editors, it was probably through James Hogg, known to us as the
Ettrick Shepherd, that Blackwood first met these two men. If
either of them could boast any literary pretensions, it was
the younger, Thomas Pringle. He was from Hogg’s country, and
Blackwood thought he divined in him the making of just such
another “rustic genius” as Hogg. Cleghorn, former editor of
the <i>Farmers’ Magazine</i>, was evidently a stick! It is difficult
to conceive how William Blackwood, with his gift of insight,
could give over the conduct of his pet plans into the hands
of such a pair. But if he made a mistake, he soon made amends.
Of the business arrangements between Blackwood and the two
editors little of definite nature is known, except that the
three were to be co-partners. Blackwood sustained the expense
of publishing and printing; Pringle and Cleghorn supplied the
material;&mdash;and the profits were to be divided! The editors
expected &pound;50 apiece per month, which seems unusual, considering
that the circulation never exceeded 2500. It looks suspiciously
probable that the early numbers were maintained at real financial
loss to the publisher. There is no mention of paying contributors
till later years. Very likely at that time writers were
still <i>above</i> remuneration! The <i>Edinburgh Review</i> had done much
to remedy this attitude, but a complete cure was not effected
for some years to come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span></p>

<p>The Prospectus of the infant journal is interesting.
It was to be “A Repository of whatever may be supposed to be
most interesting to general readers”.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> One strong point was to
be an antiquarian repository; too, it was to criticise articles
in other periodicals; it was to contain a “Register” of domestic
and foreign events. Among other aims, one was entertainment.
It was to be a miscellany of the original works of authors and
poets; and what endears it to modern hearts above all things
else, it was to be an open door for struggling young writers.
By virtue of the anonymous nature of its contributions, this
was made possible with no lessening of authority. The signatures
in the early numbers were intended to be perplexing, and perplexing
they remain to this day. But probably struggling young
writers met with less encouragement at the hands of Pringle
and Cleghorn than was William Blackwood’s original intention.
Those two never went out of the way to drum up new material,
while William Blackwood was a man alert and ever on the watch
for another Walter Scott.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a>
<i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i>, V. i, p. 2</p></div>

<p>Several numbers passed along peacefully enough.
As Mr. Lang puts it, “Nothing could be more blameless”. That
was the trouble&mdash;it was <i>too</i> blameless! Blackwood might have
forgiven a flagrant crime, but this negative and inoffensive
monthly fell with a dull thud in comparison with his mounting
expectations! He knew, none better, that a periodical of any

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
appreciable merit must necessarily bring upon itself as much
genuine censure as applause. <i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i>
for April 1817 brought neither. The great day came for the
first issue, evening followed, and Edinburgh went to bed unmoved.
With his overwhelming desire and ambition to rival the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i> and electrify Edinburgh city with a stimulating diet, it
is not likely that he would observe with much composure the
advent of this cherished scheme of his into the world, containing
for its first long article<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> six pages of “Memoirs of the
Late Francis Horner, Esq., M. P.”, one of Jeffrey’s own right
hand men!&mdash;or in finding in the department of “Periodical
Works”,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> a statistical and more or less pleasant rehashment of
the contents of the last <i>Reviews</i>. Francis Horner had ever been
one of the mainstays of the <i>Edinburgh</i>; and though it was altogether
fitting and proper that the death of an illustrious statesman
should be commemorated, it is not likely that William Blackwood
welcomed as the first article in the first number of his
new magazine, a wholly unmitigated extolling of one whose past
influence he hoped to erase. Though the publisher’s generous
mind would be the last to begrudge him the due honor of such
phrases as “highly gifted individual”, “eminent statesman”, and
the like, it cannot be imagined that he rejoiced over the words
“original and enlightened views”, “correct and elegant taste”,
when it was his ardent purpose to prove the <i>Edinburgh</i> and its

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
builders the opposite of enlightened, and the embodiment of
poor taste and incompetent judgment!</p>

<p>This same first number contains seven pages of
discourse on “The Sculpture of the Greeks”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>, and the relation
of Greek art to the environment in which it grew up,&mdash;all very
learned and interesting, to be sure. There is a brief article
on the “Present State of the City of Venice”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>, condensed and
unromantic enough to grace a Travellers’ Guide. If Messrs.
Pringle and Cleghorn had been anyone else but Messrs. Pringle
and Cleghorn, they might have indulged the public with a thrill
or two on such a subject as the city of Venice; but never a
thrill do we get from cover to cover! The article which
follows is “on the Constitution and Moral Effects of Banks for
the Savings of Industry”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>; and there are others of similar tone:
“Observations on the Culture of the Sugar Cane in the United
States”<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>, “The Craniological Controversy”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>, “The Proposed
Establishment of a Foundling Hospital in Edinburgh”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>, and the
like. One short article, “An Account of the American Steam
Frigate”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>, is still of genuine interest, attributing the conception
of the invention to a “most ingenious and enterprising
citizen”, Robert Fulton, Esq. It describes with naive emphasis

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
the successful trip “to the ocean, eastward of Sandy Hook, and
back again, a distance of fifty-three miles, in eight hours
and twenty minutes. A part of this time she had the tide against
her, and had no assistance whatever from the sails.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> It is
known that the signature Zeta was used in the early numbers,
by more than one person; but “Remarks on Greek Tragedy”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>, a
criticism of Aeschylus’ <i>Prometheus</i>, signed Zeta, Mr. Lang
attributes without hesitation to Lockhart. “Tales and Anecdotes
of Pastoral Life”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> and “Notices Concerning the Scottish Gypsies”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>
were also among the “Original Communications”, as the first
division of the magazine was called. The former is perhaps the
one attempt in the whole number at that sprightly nimble manner
which was Blackwood’s aim. The second is a long article of
some sixteen pages, delving back into the early history of the
Egyptian pilgrims, quoting copiously from “Guy Mannering”, and
referring familiarly to Walter Scott, and Mr. Fairburn and James
Hogg. Both of these articles were continued in several subsequent
numbers.</p>

<p>In another department of the contents, entitled
“Select Extracts”, there are two articles: an “Account of Colonel
Beaufoy’s Journey to the Summit of Mount Blanc”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> and the
“Account of the Remarkable Case of Margaret Lyall, Who continued

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
is a good deal when all is said. The Antiquarian Reportory
contained six articles as antiquated as one could wish, all the
way from a “Grant of the Lands of Kyrkenes by Macbeth, son of
Finlach”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> to a “Mock Poem upon the Expedition of the Highland
Host”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>. The Original Poetry department contained three poems,
none of them startling. The third one, the shortest, is by
far the best, bearing the title “Verses”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>. They were written
in honor of the entry of the Allies into Paris, 1814; and bear
the unmistakable brand and seal of James Hogg, with his ardent
song for “Auld Scotland!&mdash;land o’ hearts the wale!” ...</p>

original minds, like that of Dr. Chalmers, should arise to
advocate the cause of Christianity, it would no longer be the
fashion to exalt the triumphs of reason and of science.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
The other reviews were of “Harold, the Dauntless; a Poem. By
the Author of ‘The Bridal of Triermain’”<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>, of “Armota, a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Works, we have already spoken. Then followed “Literary and
Scientific Intelligence”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>, notices of works preparing for
publication in Edinburgh and London, and the monthly list of
new publications in the same two cities. There is a page of
French books, published since January 1817. After that the
Monthly Register of foreign intelligence, proceedings of Parliament,
the British Chronicle, commercial and agricultural reports
for the month, a meteorological table, and two pages of births,
marriages and deaths, complete the number for April 1817.</p>

<p>Mr. Lang was right when he called it “blameless”;
and it is not surprising that Blackwood made some suggestions in
regard to the second number. We know that his suggestions were
not cordially received by Messrs. Pringle and Cleghorn, and it
appears equally probable that they were not acted upon. The
second issue, May 1817, is no more resilient and has gained no
more momentum than its predecessor. The contents are cast in
the same mould: an “Account of Mr. Ruthven’s Printing Press”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>,
another on the “Method of Engraving on Stone”<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>, and “Anecdotes
of Antiquaries”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>, and the like.</p>

<p>If Blackwood was disappointed over the first
number, he was irritated at the second; but when a third of no
more vital aspect appeared, his patience gave way, and Pringle
and Cleghorn had to go! It is easy to imagine that the man

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
who did not hesitate to criticise the “Black Dwarf” would not
be overawed by the two mild gentlemen in charge of his pet
scheme. William Blackwood’s ideal had indeed been to startle
the world with a periodical which in modern terms we would call
a “live wire”. And now with the magazine actually under way, it
is not likely that a man of his stamp would sit by unperturbed,
and watch one insignificant number after another greet an unresponsive
public. After the appearance of the third number, he
gave three months’ notice to Messrs. Pringle and Cleghorn, which
somewhat excited those gentlemen, but was none the less final.
They had done all they could to evade Blackwood’s “interest in
the literary part of his business”, and intended to keep the
publisher “in his place”. William Blackwood was not made that
way, however.</p>

<p>He himself illuminates the situation in a letter to
his London agents, Baldwin, Craddock and Company, dated July
23, 1817<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>.</p>

Mrs. Oliphant: <i>Annals of a Publishing House</i>, V. i, p. 104</p></div>

<p>“I am sorry to inform you that I have been obliged
to resolve upon stopping the Magazine with No. 6. I have been
much disappointed in my editors, who have done little in the
way of writing or procuring contributions. Ever since the work
began I have had myself almost the whole burden of procuring
contributions, which by great exertions I got from my own friends,
while at the same time I had it not in my power to pay for them,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
as by our agreement the editors were to furnish me with the
whole of the material, for which and their editorial labors they
were to receive half of the profits of the work. I found this
would never do, and that the work would soon sink, as I could
not permit my friends (who have in fact made the work what it
is) to go on in this way for any length of time.... I gave
a notice, according to our agreement, that the work would close
at the period specified in it&mdash;three months. Instead, however,
of Pringle acting in the friendly way he professed, he joined
Cleghorn, and without giving any explanation, they concluded
a bargain with Constable and Company, by which I understand they
take charge of their (Constable’s) ‘Scot’s Magazine’ as soon
as mine stops.”</p>

<p>“It is not of the least consequence to me losing
them, as they were quite unfit for what they undertook....
I have, however, made an arrangement with a gentleman of first-rate
talents by which I will begin a new work of very superior
kind. I mention this to you, however, in the strictest confidence,
as I am not at liberty yet to say anything more particularly
about it.... My editors have very dishonestly made it
known to a number of people that we stop at the sixth number.
This will interfere a little with our sale here, but I hope
not with you.”</p>

<p>The editors wrangled at great length, but Blackwood’s
mind was made up, and as we see by the foregoing letter,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
already launching new plans and busy with them. A letter to
Pringle and Cleghorn, gives us the first hint of John Wilson’s
connection with the magazine (other than mere contributor), and
shows the tone of finality with which Blackwood could treat what
was to him a settled subject:</p>

<p>“As you have now an interest directly opposite to
mine, I hope you will not think it unreasonable that I should be
made acquainted with the materials which you intend for this
number. It occurs to me it would save all unpleasant discussion
if you were inclined to send the different articles to Mr. John
Wilson, who has all along taken so deep an interest in the magazine.
I do not wish to offer my opinion with regard to the
fitness or unfitness of any article, but I should expect that you
would be inclined to listen to anything which Mr. Wilson might
suggest. He had promised me the following articles: Account of
Marlowe’s Edward II, Argument in the Case of the Dumb Woman
lately before the Court, Vindication of Wordsworth, Reviews of
Lament of Tasso, Poetical Epistles and Spencer’s Tour. His
furnishing these or even other articles will, however, depend
upon the articles you have got and intend to insert.”</p>

<p>“I beg to assure you that it is my most anxious
wish to have the whole business settled speedily and as amicably
as possible.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<p>Here exit the prologue; and the real show begins
with <i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i> for October 1817. To attract
attention was Blackwood’s first aim; interest once aroused,
he did not worry over maintaining it. Of that he felt assured.
Respectability, mediocrity were taboo! By respectability is
inferred that prudent, cautious, dead-alive respectability whose
backbone (such as it has) is fear of public censure!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<h2 id="III">III<br />

<i>Dramatis Personae</i></h2>

<p>One of Blackwood’s aims in life was to make
17 Princes Street a literary rendez-vous; and indeed the background
and atmosphere of “Maga”, and the men who gathered round
it, are perhaps as fascinating and absorbing as the magazine
itself!</p>

<p>Blackwood’s shop is described by Lockhart as
“the only great lounging shop in the new Town of Edinburgh”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>.
A glimpse of the soil and lights and shades which nourished
“Maga” cannot help but bring a warmer, more familiar comprehension
of its character and the words it spake. Just as Park
Street and the Shaw Memorial and the grave portraits of its
departed builders color our own <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, just so did
17 Princes Street tinge and permeate the magazine which grew up
in its precincts. “The length of vista presented to one on
entering the shop”, says Lockhart, “has a very imposing effect;
for it is carried back, room after room, through various gradations
of light and shadow, till the eye cannot trace distinctly
the outline of any object in the furthest distance. First, there
is as usual, a spacious place set apart for retail-business, and
a numerous detachment of young clerks and apprentices, to whose
management that important department of the concern is intrusted.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Then you have an elegant oval saloon, lighted from the roof,
where various groupes of loungers and literary dilettanti are
engaged in looking at, or criticising among themselves, the
publications just arrived by that day’s coach from town. In
such critical colloquies the voice of the bookseller himself
may ever and anon be heard mingling the broad and unadulterated
notes of its Auld Reekie music; for unless occupied in the
recesses of the premises with some other business, it is here
that he has his station.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>From this it is evident Blackwood’s ideal shop was
realized, and that there did gather in his presence both those
who wielded the pen and those who wished to, those who were
critics and those who aspired to be. At these assemblies might
often be found two young men, who, says Mrs. Oliphant, “would
have been remarkable anywhere if only for their appearance and
talk, had nothing more remarkable ever been developed in them”.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
These two, of course, were John Wilson and John Gibson Lockhart.
She continues: “Both of them were only too keen to see the
ludicrous aspect of everything, and the age gave them an extraordinary
licence in exposing it.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> This is an important note,
the “extraordinary licence” of the age,&mdash;a straw eagerly
grasped at!&mdash;corroborated, too, by Lord Cockburn<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> who testifies:

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
“There was a natural demand for libel at this period.” It
explains much that we would fain explain in the subsequent
literary pranks of these same two youths. They were ready for
anything; and more,&mdash;enthusiastically ready for anything. John
Wilson was a giant, intellectually and physically, “a genial
giant but not a mild one”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>. Lockhart had already made some
small reputation for himself as a caricaturist. Perhaps it was
insight into their capacities which strengthened Blackwood’s
disgust with the two mild gents in charge of his to-be-epoch-making
organ! At any rate, it was to these two, Wilson especially,
that he turned for the resuscitation of his dream.</p>

<p>John Wilson is the one name most commonly associated
with <i>Blackwood’s</i>, and with the exception of William Blackwood
himself, perhaps the most important figure in its reconstruction.
The name Christopher North was used in the earlier years by
various contributors, but was soon appropriated by Wilson and
is now almost exclusively associated with him. In the latter part
of 1817 he became Blackwood’s right hand man. He has often been
considered editor of “Maga”, but strictly speaking, no one but
Blackwood ever was. After the experience with Pringle and
Cleghorn, William Blackwood would naturally be wary of ever
again entrusting full authority to anyone. He himself was
always the guiding and ruling spirit, though never admittedly,
or technically, editor.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>It was “Maga” that gave John Wilson his first real
literary opportunity. His gifts were critical rather than creative,
and his most famous work is the collected “Noctes Ambrosianae”
which began to run in the March number (1822) of <i>Blackwood’s
Edinburgh Magazine</i>. He was one of the very first to
praise Wordsworth; and though in general, far too superlative
both in praise and blame to be considered dependable, a very great
deal of his criticism holds good to the present hour. Along in
the first days of Wordsworth’s career, Wilson proclaimed him, with
Scott and Byron, “one of the three great master spirits of our
day in the poetical world”. Lockhart, long his close friend and
associate, writes thus: “He is a very warm, enthusiastic man,
with most charming conversational talents, full of fiery imaginations,
irresistible in eloquence, exquisite in humor when he
talks ...; he is a most fascinating fellow, and a most kind-hearted,
generous friend; but his fault is a sad one, a total
inconsistency in his opinions concerning both men and things....
I ... believe him incapable of doing anything dishonorable either
in literature or in any other way.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

A. Lang: <i>Life and Letters of John Gibson Lockhart</i>, V. i, p. 93</p></div>

<p>It was the pen of John Gibson Lockhart, however,
almost as wholly as Wilson’s which insured the success of the
magazine; and Blackwood was as eager to enlist Lockhart into his
services as Wilson. Like Wilson, too, “Maga” was Lockhart’s
opportunity! He had given early promise as a future critic.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Elton says he wrote “sprightly verse and foaming prose”.
From 1817 to 1830 he was not only one of the invaluable supporters
of “Maga”, but one of its rare <i>lights</i>! In announcing
the marriage of his daughter to Lockhart, Sir Walter Scott
said: “To a young man of uncommon talents, indeed of as promising
a character as I know”.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> His gift for caricature colored his
writings. His was a mind and eye and genius for the comic.
His satire was that keen and bitter piercing satire which all
are ready to recognize as talent, but few are ready to forgive
if once subjected to it. But there was little malice behind it
ever. Much of what he wrote has been condemned for its bitter,
and often personal, import. But Lockhart was only twenty-three
at the time of his first connection with the magazine&mdash;and
what is more, “constitutionally a mocker”. All is well with
his serious work, but according to Mr. Lang, the “Imp of the
Perverse” was his ruling genius! Others say, “as a practitioner
in the gentle art of making enemies, Lockhart excelled”,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and
that he possessed the “native gift of insolence”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>. They are
strong words, not wholly without cause, and illustrate the
attitude of many minds towards his work; yet perhaps they only
go to prove that he began to write responsible articles too
young, and was allowed entirely too free a swing.</p>

<p>The story of James Hogg is by far the most fascinating
of those connected with <i>Blackwood’s</i>; and in a later series
of articles in that magazine on these first three stars, the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
writer says: “Hogg was undoubtedly the most remarkable. For
his was an untaught and self-educated genius, which shone with
rare though fitful lustre in spite of all disadvantages, and
surmounted obstacles that were seemingly insuperable.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> It is
difficult to ascertain his exact relations with the magazine.
One thing at least is certain,&mdash;he contributed much. Wilson
and Lockhart found great joy in “drawing” him, and Hogg was
kept wavering between vexation and pride “at occupying so much
space in the most popular periodical of the day”.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> As Saintsbury
puts it, he was at once the “inspiration, model, and butt
of <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>. But indeed the shepherd drawn so
cleverly in the Noctes “was not”, his daughter testifies,
“the Shepherd of Ettrick, or the man James Hogg”. And in all
justice to him, there can be no doubt that he is totally misrepresented
therein.</p>

<p>His poetry is his only claim upon the world. It
was the one thing dearest to his own heart, and the one thing for
which he claimed or craved distinction or recognition of any
kind. The heart warms to this youth with his dreams and aspirations,
brain teeming with poems years before he learned to write.
As might be expected from a man whose own grandfather had conversed
with fairies, in Hogg’s poetry the supernatural is close
to the natural world. He is reported once to have said to his
friend Sir Walter Scott: “Dear Sir Walter! Ye can never suppose

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
that I belang to your School o’ Chivalry! Ye are the king o’
that school, but I’m the king o’ the Mountain and Fairy School,
which is a far higher ane nor yours.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> This “sublime egotism”
is not displeasing in one whose heart and soul was wrapt up
in an earnest belief in and reverence for his art. It is the
egotism of a deep nature which scorns to hide its talents in
the earth. James Hogg spoke to the heart of Scotland, and
was proud and content in so doing.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">65</a>
<i>Memorials of James Hogg</i>, p. x</p></div>

<p>To all appearances Blackwood was now the centre of
a group after his own heart! With these three as a nucleus,
others of considerable talent joined the circle. Talent, wit,
keen and zealous minds were theirs, with enough fervor and
intrepidity of spirit to guarantee that “Maga” would never again
pass unnoticed. Henceforth there was sensation enough to satisfy
even the heart of a William Blackwood! Whatever accusations
were afterwards levelled at “Maga” (and they were many) no one
could again accuse it of being either dull or uninteresting&mdash;the
one unpardonable sin of book or magazine! The last thing
that “Maga” wished to be was neutral! Better to offend than be
only “inoffensive”; better to raise a rumpus than grow respectable!
And from October 1817 on, “respectable” is the last
word anyone thought of applying to <i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i>!

<i>First Years of “Maga”</i></h2>

<p>With its new grip on life in October 1817, the
editorial notice of Blackwood’s omitted any profession of a new
prospectus. It reads: “In place of a formal Prospectus, we now
lay before our Readers the titles of some of the articles which
we have either already received, or which are in preparation by
our numerous correspondents.” Follows some two pages or more of
titles alluring and otherwise, whereupon the notice continues:
“The Public will observe, from the above list of articles, that
we intend our Magazine to be a Depository of Miscellaneous Information
and Discussion. We shall admit every Communication of
Merit, whatever may be the opinion of the writer, on Literature,
Poetry, Philosophy, Statistics, Politics, Manners, and Human
Life.... We invite all intelligent persons ... to lay their
ideas before the world in our Publication; and we only reserve to
ourselves the right of commenting upon what we do not approve.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
That right was always reserved, and there was never any hesitancy
on the part of any of them in acting thereon, as the magazine
itself testifies.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">66</a>

<p>A short paragraph of “Notices to Correspondents”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
following the editorial notice, is of more than casual interest.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Its flavor is shown by the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The communication of Lupus is not admissible.
D. B.’s Archaeological Notices are rather heavy. We are obliged
to our worthy Correspondent M. for his History of ‘Bowed
David’, but all the anecdotes of that personage are incredibly
stupid, so let his bones rest in peace.... We have received an
interesting Note enclosing a beautiful little Poem, from Mr. Hector
Macneil ... and need not say how highly we value his communication....
Duck-lane, a Town Eclogue, by Leigh Hunt&mdash;and the
Innocent Incest by the same gentleman, are under consideration;
their gross indecency must however be washed out. If we have
been imposed upon by some wit, these compositions will not be
inserted. Mr. James Thomson, private secretary for the charities
of the Dukes of York and Kent, is, we are afraid, a very bad Poet,
nor can the Critical Opinions of the Princes of the Blood Royal
be allowed to influence ours.... Reason has been given for our
declining to notice various other communications.” Many of the
contributors, probably most of them, received personal letters;
in fact, this paragraph does not appear in every number.</p>

<p>This number, <i>The</i> number of <i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh
Magazine</i>, the startling and blood-curdling number of October
1817, contained among other sensations, the Chaldee Manuscript,
supposedly from the “Bibliotheque Royale” (Salle 2, No. 53, B.
A. M. M.)&mdash;in reality a clever and scathing piece of satire

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
couched in Biblical language, which spared no one of note in
the whole town of Edinburgh, and written by heaven knows whom!
Its interest was strictly local, dealing with Edinburgh and
Edinburgh personalities, written with the Edinburgh public in
view; but its fame spread like wild fire! Like Byron, <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i> woke up one morning to find itself grown famous over
night! As Mrs. Oliphant puts it: “Edinburgh woke up with a
roar of laughter, with a shout of delight, with convulsions of
rage and offense”. Its fame involved, however, not only the
clamor of Edinburgh, but instant recognition throughout the
kingdom. Result? Libel actions, challenges to duels, lawsuits,
and&mdash;the suppression of the Chaldee Manuscript. Its fame has
come down to the present day, but one peep at it involves carfare
to the British Museum!</p>

<p>This amazing piece of literature seems innocent
enough at first glance; and in truth it was what people read <i>into</i>
it rather than what they read <i>in</i> it that made all the trouble.
Quoting from it:</p>

<p>“I looked, and behold a man clothed in plain apparel
stood in the door of his house: and I saw his name ... and his
name was as it had been the color of ebony, and his number was
as the number of a maiden&mdash;(17 Princes Street, of course)....</p>

<p>“And I turned my eyes, and behold two beasts came
from the lands of the borders of the South; and when I saw them
I wondered with great admiration.... And they came

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
unto the man ... and they said unto him, Give us of thy
wealth, that we may eat and live ... and they proffered him
a Book; and they said unto him, Take Thou this and give us a
sum of money, ... and we will put words into the Book that will
astonish the children of thy people.... And the man hearkened unto
their voice, and he took the Book and gave them a piece of
money, and they went away rejoicing in their hearts.... But
after many days they put no words in the Book; and the man
was astonished and waxed wroth, and he said unto them, What is
this that ye have done unto me, and how shall I answer those to
whom I am engaged? And they said, what is that to us? See
thou to that.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>All this seems innocent tomfoolery enough&mdash;pure
parody on our friend Ebony, and the two beasts Pringle and Cleghorn
who “put no words in the Book”. But that was not all,
Constable and the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> figured prominently; and
Sir Walter Scott who, we are told, “almost choked with laughter”,
and Wilson and Lockhart and Hogg.</p>

<p>“There lived also a man that was <i>crafty</i> in council ...
and he had a notable horn in his forehead with which he
ruled the nations. And I saw the horn that it had eyes, and
a mouth speaking great things, and it magnified itself ... and

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and
prospered.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">69</a>
Ibid., V. i, p. 121</p></div>

<p>Constable never outlived this name of the Crafty
and the reputation of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> for “magnifying itself”
lives to the present day. “The beautiful leopard from the
valley of the palm-trees” (meaning Wilson) “called from a far
country the Scorpion which delighted to sting the faces of men”,
(Lockhart, of course) “that he might sting sorely the countenance
of the man that is crafty, and of the two beasts.</p>

<p>“And he brought down the great wild boar from the
forest of Lebanon and he roused up his spirits and I saw him
whittling his dreadful tusks for the battle.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> This last is
James Hogg. There were others. Walter Scott was the “great
Magician which has his dwelling in the old fastness hard by the
river Jordan, which is by the Border”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> to whom Constable, the
Crafty, appealed for advice. Francis Jeffrey was “a familiar
spirit unto whom he (the Crafty) had sold himself”.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> The attack
on the Rev. Prof. Playfair, later so sincerely deplored in <i>Peter’s
Letters</i>, reads in part thus: “He also is of the seed of the
prophets, and ministered in the temple while he was yet young;
but he went out and became one of the scoffers”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>&mdash;in other
words, one of the Edinburgh Reviewers! The spirit of prophecy

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
seems indeed to have been upon the writer of the Chaldee, for
it ends&mdash;appropriately, thus: “I fled into an inner chamber
to hide myself, and I heard a great tumult, but I wist not
what it was.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> The great tumult was heard, to be sure, and the
authors fled to be safe.</p>

<p>Just who wrote the Chaldee will never be known;
but all indications are that the idea and first draft were James
Hogg’s, and that it was touched up and completed by Wilson and
Lockhart, with the aid, or rather with the suggestions and approval
of William Blackwood.</p>

<p>The number for August 1821 contains the first of
a series of “Familiar Epistles to Christopher North, From an
Old Friend with a New Face.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Letter I deals with Hogg’s
Memoirs. This is anticipating a bit, anticipating some four
years, in fact, but is nevertheless apropos of our discussion
of the Chaldee. Just who the Old Friend with a New Face was
would be hard to judge. Mr. Lang has surmised him to be either
Lockhart or De Quincey. It is a lively bit of work, worthy the
wit of either, but the sentences do not feel like Lockhart’s.
That both these men were friends of Hogg, encourages one to
hope that the biting sarcasm of the thing was its own excuse
for being, and came not from the heart. Such was ever the tone
of “Maga”, however; and none can deny that once begun the article
<i>must</i> be read! Excerpts follow: “Of all speculations in the way

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
of printed paper, I should have thought the most hopeless to
have been ‘a Life of James Hogg, by himself’. Pray who wishes
to know anything about his life? ...</p>

<p>“It is no doubt undeniable that the political state
of Europe is not so interesting as it was some years ago. But
still I maintain that there was no demand for the Life of James
Hogg.... At all events, it ought not to have appeared before
the Life of Buonaparte.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>But to come again to our Chaldee Manuscript, the
correspondent says concerning Hogg’s claim to its authorship:
“There is a bouncer!&mdash;The Chaldee Manuscript!&mdash;Why, no more
did he write the Chaldee Manuscript than the five books of
Moses.... I presume that Mr. Hogg is also the author of
Waverley.&mdash;He may say so if he chooses.... It must be a delightful
thing to have such fancies as these in one’s noodle;&mdash;but
on the subject of the Chaldee Manuscript, let me now speak the
truth. You yourself, Kit ... and myself, Blackwood and a
reverend gentleman of this city alone know the perpetrator.
It was the same person who murdered Begbie!”&mdash;Begbie, by the
way, was a bank porter, whose murder was one of the never solved
mysteries of Edinburgh. “It was a disease with him to excite
'public emotion’. With respect to his murdering Begbie ... all
at once it entered his brain, that, by putting him to death in

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
a sharp and clever and mysterious manner ... the city of
Edinburgh would be thrown into a ferment of consternation, and
there would be no end of ‘public emotion’.... The scheme succeeded
to a miracle.... Mr. &mdash;&mdash; wrote the Chaldee Manuscript
precisely on the same principle.... It was the last work of
the kind of which I have been speaking, that he lived to
finish. He confessed it and the murder the day before he died,
to the gentleman specified, and was sufficiently penitent....</p>

<p>“After this plain statement, Hogg must look extremely
foolish. We shall next have him claiming the murder, likewise,
I suppose; but he is totally incapable of either.”<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="label">77</a>
Ibid., V. x, p. 49-50</p></div>

<p>It is altogether probable that Hogg’s frank avowal
dismayed the men who had studied to keep its authorship secret
for so many years, fearing lest the confession implicate his
colleagues. At any rate, such vehement protestations as the
above are to be eyed askance in the light of saner evidences.
“Maga” was prone to go off on excursions of this kind; and
William Blackwood had at last realized his dreamed-of Sensation!
No doubt he knew the risk he took in publishing the Chaldee;
but in the tumult which followed, he stood equal to every occasion.
Hogg was not then in Edinburgh, and Wilson and Lockhart
too thought it wise to leave town. The letters of the two latter
to Blackwood during the days of the libel suits remind one of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the tragic notes of boys of twelve a la penny dreadful!
But Blackwood was firm and undisturbed through it all, disclaiming
all responsibility himself, never disclosing a single name.
The secret was safe and the success of “Maga” sure. In the
November number, however, he saw fit to insert such statements
as the following: “The Publisher is aware that every effort
has been used to represent the admission into his Magazine of
an article entitled “A Translation of a Chaldee Manuscript”
as an offence worthy of being visited with a punishment that
would involve in it his ruin as a Bookseller and Publisher. He
is confident, however, that his conduct will not be thought by
the Public to merit such a punishment, and to them he accordingly
appeals.”<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>&mdash;And again, on a page by itself in the same
November number appears the following statement: “The Editor
has learned with regret that an Article in the First Edition of
last Number, which was intended merely as a <i>jeu d’esprit</i>, has
been construed so as to give offence to Individuals justly
entitled to respect and regard; he has on that account withdrawn
it in the Second Edition, and can only add, that if what has
happened could have been anticipated, the Article in question
certainly never would have appeared.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">79</a>
Ibid., V. ii, p. 129</p></div>

<p>Aside from the Chaldee, there were two other distinct
and decided Sensations in this memorable number, both too well

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
known to demand detailed attention. They were Wilson’s attack
on Coleridge, “Observations on Coleridge’s Biographia Literaria”,<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
the leading article and a long one; and Lockhart’s paper “On
the Cockney School of Poetry”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>. The former is an inexcusable,
ranting thing which concludes that Mr. Coleridge’s Literary
Life strengthens every argument against the composition of
such Memoirs”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>, ... that it exhibits “many mournful sacrifices
of personal dignity, after which it seems impossible that Mr.
Coleridge can be greatly respected either by the Public or himself.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
Such words were strong enough in their own day, but
seem doubly presumptuous in the light of our present hero-worship,&mdash;especially
as the article continues with verdicts like the following:
“Considered merely in a literary point of view, the work
is most execrable.... His admiration of Nature or of man,&mdash;we
had almost said his religious feelings toward his God,&mdash;are all
narrowed, weakened, and corrupted and poisoned by inveterate and
diseased egotism.”...<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>This was a sin for which “Maga” later atoned by
repeated tributes to his genius, to his poetry and its beauty
in many subsequent numbers of the periodical. Lockhart two
years afterwards spoke of it as “a total departure from the principles
of the Magazine”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>&mdash;“a specimen of the very worst kind of

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
spirit which the Magazine professed to be fighting in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> “This is indeed the only one of the
various sins of this Magazine for which I am at a loss to discover&mdash;not
an apology&mdash;but a motive. If there be any man of
grand and original genius alive at this moment in Europe, such
a man is Mr. Coleridge.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> And two months after this paper,
in the issue for December 1817 appeared a “Letter to the Reviewer
of Coleridge’s Biographia Literaria”, beginning with the
words: “To be blind to our failings and alive to our prejudices,
is the fault of almost every one of us.... It is the same
with me, the same with Mr. Coleridge, and it is, I regret to
state it, the same with his reviewer!”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>... And this writer,
who signs, himself J. S., sums up his valiant defense, declaring
“it is from a love I have for generous and fair criticism, and
a hate to everything which appears personal and levelled against
the man and not his subject&mdash;and your writing is glaringly so&mdash;that
I venture to draw daggers with a reviewer. You have indeed
imitated, with not a little of its power and ability, the worst
manner of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> critics. Forgetting ... that
freedom of remark does not exclude the kind and courteous style,
you have entirely sunk the courteousness in the virulency of
it.”<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Thus “Maga” redeemed itself and Coleridge was avenged.</p>

<p>As for the third of the three articles which
best illustrate the whoopla-spirit of this new venture, Lockhart’s
paper “On the Cockney School of Poetry”, all is said
when we say it was the first of a series of corrosive and
scurrilous articles directed against Leigh Hunt in particular,
and Hazlitt and Webbe, and in general, the “younger and less
important members” of that school, “The Shelley’s and the
Keatses”! Modern critics! Beware how you cast stones at
our Percy Smith’s and Reggie Brown’s! Says our young friend
Lockhart in this article that Leigh Hunt is “a man of little
education. He knows absolutely nothing of Greek, almost nothing
of Latin”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> ... and so forth and so on. He cannot “utter a
dedication, or even a note, without betraying the <i>Shibboleth</i>
of low birth and low habits. He is the ideal of a Cockney
poet.... He has never seen any mountain higher than Highgate-hill,
nor reclined by any streams more pastoral than the Serpentine
River. But he is determined to be a poet eminently rural,
and he rings the changes&mdash;till one is sick of him, on the
beauties of the different ‘high views’ which he has taken of
God and nature, in the course of some Sunday dinner parties
at which he has assisted in the neighborhood of London.... As
a vulgar man is perpetually laboring to be genteel&mdash;in like
manner the poetry of this man is always on the stretch to be
grand.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>This is just a taste of what is in reality very
clever stuff. The subject of approbation or disapprobation
had best be omitted. At any rate “Maga” “started something”,
for the term “Cockney School” was taken up by the major and
minor Reviews and nearly every daily paper of England and
Scotland. What Wilson said later (1832) in a review of Tennyson’s
poems, characterizes the <i>Blackwood</i> attitude toward the
Cockneys from the first: “Were the Cockneys to be to church,
we should be strongly tempted to break the Sabbath.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> Whatever
our evaluation of this sort of criticism, the admission perhaps
saves the reputation of Lockhart and other <i>Blackwood</i> critics!
Their opposition was more a matter of principle than of
judgment.</p>

<p>The rest of the contents of the October 1817 number
are interesting and lively, though it must be admitted scarcely
so startling as this famous triad. A discussion of the
“Curious Meteorological Phenomena Observed in Argyleshire”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
reads interestingly and rapidly, and is of sufficient weight
to save the magazine from flying away altogether! “Analytical
Essays on the Early English Dramatists, No. II., Marlowe’s
Edward II”<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> is the work of John Wilson, and bears the stamp of
his outpouring of appreciation and enthusiasm. Another article,
“On the Optical Properties of Mother-of-Pearl, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> seems to

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
be a purely scientific offering, and so far as the writer
can judge, presumably accurate and just as it should be. Page
47 bears side by side, a tender little “Elegy” of James Hogg’s
and a poem in honor of the Ettrick Shepherd and his songs
by John Wilson. “Strictures on the Edinburgh Review”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> and
“Remarks on the Quarterly Review”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> are two articles one would
scarcely go to sleep over.</p>

<p>There are other papers in this same issue which
time will not allow even brief mention. It is easy to picture
the great publisher when the new copies first arrived, crisp
and new with the smell of printers’ ink upon them. There was
no despair, no disappointment this time, but the eager palpitation
and anxiety of the parent, solicitous but equally certain
of the success of his child! A letter penned in haste to
John Wilson before ever “Maga” was seen by public eye betrays
better than any polite effusion could have done, the genuine
emotion of the man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant draws a pretty picture, which
reveals better perhaps than some more erudite account, the
mental state of William Blackwood the night before “Maga”
was offered to the world. “He went into his house, where all
the children ... rushed out with clamor and glee to meet their
father, who, for once in his excitement, took no notice of
them, but walked straight to the drawing room, where his wife,
not excitable, sat in her household place, busy no doubt for
her fine family; and coming into the warm glow of the light,
threw down the precious Magazine at her feet. ‘There is that
that will give you what is your due&mdash;what I always wished
you to have’, he said, with the half-sobbing laugh of the great
crisis. She gave him a characteristic word, half-satirical,
as was her way, not outwardly moved.... Sometimes he called her
a wet blanket when she thus damped his ardor,&mdash;but not, I
think, that night.”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>It might easily be guessed that after the sudden
bursting into glory of the October number, the same high level

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
would be difficult to sustain. But although subsequent numbers
boast no Chaldee to convulse or enrage the town, the popularity
of “Maga” seems never again to lag. The November number begins
properly enough. The afore-mentioned apology and explanation
of the Chaldee introduced it to the watchful waiters, impatient
to ascertain what a second issue would bring forth. The first
long article, nine and a half pages, “On the Pulpit Eloquence
of Scotland”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a>, very thoughtful, very serious, very earnest, in
tone, thanks God that Scotland has been blessed with the
heavenly visitation of her well loved preacher, Dr. Chalmers,
and extols and praises and appreciates the man, “like an angel
in a dream”. The second article continues the learned discussion
“On the Optical Properties of Mother-of-Pearl”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>. The
third is John Wilson’s famous review of Byron’s “Lament of
Tasso”<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>, wherein says he “There is one Poem in which he
(Byron) has almost wholly laid aside all remembrance of the
darker and stormier passions; in which the tone of his spirit
and his voice at once is changed, and where he who seemed to
care only for agonies, and remorse, and despair, and death, and
insanity, in all their most appalling forms, shews that he has
a heart that can feed on the purest sympathies of our nature,
and deliver itself up to the sorrows, the sadness and the
melancholy of humbler souls.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p>The lighter tone again asserts itself in “Letters
of An Old Bachelor, No. 1.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>, who waxes indignant over French
opinion concerning English ladies! He quotes a certain French
writer who represents “the dress of the English ladies” as mere
imitation of the French, only “all ridicule and exaggeration.
'Does a French lady, for instance, put a flower in her hair&mdash;the
heads of the English ladies are immediately covered with the
whole shop of a bouqueti&egrave;re. Does a French lady put on a
feather ... in this country&mdash;nothing but feathers is to be
seen!’ This, of course”, says the old bachelor in all earnestness,
“is all a vile slander”<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>,&mdash;although he must admit having
seen heads covered with flowers, and “ladies wearing <i>quite as
many</i> feathers as were becoming.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> He resents too that a
French priest should accuse English ladies of having bad teeth.
“Is he ignorant”, he would know, “that young ladies by applying
to Mr. Scott, the dentist, may be supplied with a single tooth
for the small sum of two guineas, while dowagers may be accommodated
with a complete set of the <i>most beautiful</i> teeth, made
from the tusks of the hippopotamus ... for a very trifling consideration?
In fact, it is quite astonishing, to see the fine
teeth of all our female acquaintances;... And yet this abominable
priest has the impudence to talk of bad teeth!”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Besides,
“what ladies of any nation”, says he, “play so charmingly the
pianoforte?”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>This little skit is followed by the second installment
“On the Cockney School of Poetry”<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>,&mdash;this time that well
known and scandalous handling of Hunt’s “Story of Rimini”,&mdash;Lockhart’s
again, of course. This was the article whose turbulent
discussion of the moral depravity of Leigh Hunt threw
Baldwin, Cradock and Joy, then Blackwood’s London agents, into
such a state of pious horror. They evidently feared getting
mixed up in anything livelier than antiquarian projects, and
threatened to withdraw their name. The articles on the Cockney
School went merrily on, however; and so did Baldwin and Cradock
even until July 1818. No doubt they found it a paying proposition!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="label">109</a>

<p>Sir Walter Scott tried to wean both Wilson and
Lockhart away from “that mother of mischief”<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> as he termed the
magazine. According to Mr. Lang, he “disapproved (though he
chuckled over it) the reckless extravagance of juvenile satire”.
But it is easy to comprehend how “a chuckle” from Sir Walter
would be the last incentive to curb their literary abandon.
Blackwood worked long for the support of Scott, knowing well
what it would mean to “Maga”. A semblance of support, at
least, he secured through his patronage of Scott’s favorite,
William Laidlaw, whose agricultural chronicles ran for a time
as one of the regular features. Scott even contributed an
occasional article himself from time to time, which, though

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
anonymous, could not escape recognition. Probably he never
attained a very cordial affection for the publisher, and it
is well known that he disapproved of much that “Maga” said and
did, yet outwardly he professed neutrality between <i>Constable’s</i>
and <i>Blackwood’s</i>; and in a letter to William Laidlaw, February
1818, while “Maga” was still in its youth, his verdict is not
vindictive. “Blackwood is rather in a bad pickle just now&mdash;sent
to Coventry by the trade, as the booksellers call themselves
and all about the parody of the two beasts. Surely these gentlemen
think themselves rather formed of porcelain clay than of
common potters’ ware. Dealing in satire against all others,
their own dignity suffers so cruelly from an ill-imagined joke!
If B. had good books to sell, he might set them all at defiance.
His Magazine does well and beats Constable’s; but we will talk
of this when we meet.”<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p>Continuing the panorama, the issue for February
1818 contains three pages of notes “To Correspondents”, of
which several deserve mention: “We have no objection to insert
Z.’s Remarks on Mr. Hazlitt’s Lectures, after our present Correspondent’s
Notices are completed. If Mr. Hazlitt uttered
personalities against the Poets of the Lake School, he reviled
those who taught him all he knows about poetry.” This same
issue was then starting a series of articles entitled “Notices
of a Course of Lectures on English Poetry, by W. Hazlitt”.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
With no personal comment, they give the gist of Hazlitt’s
lectures at the Surrey Institution in London. The first
article covers the lectures on “Poetry in General”<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>, “On
Chaucer and Spenser”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>, and “On Shakespeare and Milton”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>. These
papers ran for several months, and the promised Remarks of
Z. do not appear in any recognizable form unless the paper
“Hazlitt Cross-Questioned”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> in the August issue (1818) is the
awaited article. It is presented in the form of eight questions,
the first: “Did you, or did you not, in the course of your
late Lectures on Poetry, infamously vituperate and sneer at
the character of Mr. Wordsworth&mdash;I mean his personal character;
his genius even you dare not deny?”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Again&mdash;“Do you know the
difference between Milton’s Latin and Milton’s Greek?”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> and&mdash;“Did
you not insinuate in an essay on Shakespeare ... that
Desdemona was a lewd woman, and after that dare to publish a
book on Shakespeare?”<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> The eighth question closes the article:
“Do you know the Latin for a goose?”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></p>

<p>But to return to our notes “To Correspondents”
in February 1818, there remains one or two others of especial
interest as illustrating the attitude these notes assumed.
For instance: “Can C. C. believe it possible to pass off on
us for an original composition, an extract from so popular a

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
work as Mrs. Grant’s Essay on the Superstitions of the Highlands?
May his plagiarisms, however, always be from works
equally excellent.” Another: “The foolish parody which
has been sent us is inadmissible for two reasons; first, because
it is malevolent; and secondly, because it is dull.” We are
inclined to think the latter was the decisive reason.</p>

<p>This same issue includes the first contribution of
a man who was henceforth to wield an important pen in the make-up
of the magazine&mdash;one William Maginn. He was a brilliant
writer, and a reckless, and contributed copiously. Some one
has characterized him as “a perfectly ideal magazinist”. The
article, “Some Account of the Life and Writings of Ensign and
Adjutant Odoherty, Late of the 99th Regiment”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>, well reveals
the serio-comic tone of his work which was so popular. Ensign
Odoherty was destined to fill many a future page. In fact,
Maginn was “a find”!</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">121</a>
Ibid., V. ii, p. 562</p></div>

<p>Quoting from this article: “One evening ... I had
the misfortune, from some circumstances here unnecessary to
mention, to be conveyed for a night’s lodging to the watch-house
in Dublin. I had there the good fortune to meet Mr.
Odoherty, who was likewise a prisoner. He was seated on a wooden
stool, before a table garnished with a great number of empty
pots of porter.... With all that urbanity of manner by which he
was distinguished, he asked me ‘to take a sneaker of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
swipes’.”<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> This is the Ensign Odoherty of whom it is said
“Never was there a man more imbued with the very soul and
spirit of poetry.... Cut off in the bloom of his years,
ere the fair and lovely blossoms of his youth had time to
ripen into the golden fruit by which the autumn of his days
would have been beautified and adorned,”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>&mdash;etc.&mdash;“His
wine ... was never lost on him, and, towards the conclusion
of the third bottle he was always excessively amusing.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
The writer offers one or two specimens of Odoherty’s poetry,
among them verses to a lady to whom he never declared himself.
“This moving expression of passion”, we are told, “appears
to have produced no effect on the obdurate fair one, who was
then fifty-four years of age, with nine children, and a large
jointure, which would certainly have made a very convenient
addition to the income of Mr. Odoherty.”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> On being appointed
to an ensigncy in the West Indies, he sailed for Jamaica with
a certain Captain Godolphin, and has left a charming poetical
record of the trip, of which the following will sufficiently
impress the reader:

<span class="table">
<span class="trow">“The captain’s wife, she sailed with him, this circumstance I heard of her,<br /></span>
<span class="trow">Her brimstone breath, ‘twas almost death to come within a yard of her;<br /></span>
<span class="trow">With fiery nose, as red as rose, to tell no lies I’ll stoop,<br /></span>
<span class="trow">She looked just like an admiral with a lantern at his poop.”<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a><br /></span>
</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>

The whole poem is not quoted, but the latter part of it gives
an account “of how Mrs. Godolphin was killed by a cannon
ball lodging in her stomach”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>, as well as other pathetic and
moving events. In describing the rest of the stanzas, however,
Maginn assures us, “It is sufficient to say they are fully
equal to the preceding, and are distinguished by the same quaintness
of imagination.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>!</p>

<p>This article is followed by “Notices of the Acted
Drama in London”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>, the second of a series of sixteen articles
which ran regularly, January 1818 to June 1820.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> These are
decidedly interesting,&mdash;even thrilling, if such a term may be
employed,&mdash;in that they approach with contemporary assurance
names which dramatic legend bids the present day revere:&mdash;Mr.
Kean, Mrs. Siddons, Miss O’Neil, Mr. C. Kemble, and others.
The first of these articles (January 1818) states: “our fixed
opinions are few;” ... but continues further that one of these
fixed opinions is that “it would be better for all the world
if he (Shakespeare) could be thought of as a poet only&mdash;not
as a writer of acting dramas. If it had not been for Mr.
Kean, we should never have desired to see a play of Shakespeare’s
acted again.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> As for Desdemona,</p>


<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“The gentle lady married to the Moor!&mdash;</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“If we had been left to ourselves we could have fancied her

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
anything or anybody we liked, and have changed the fancy at
our will. But, as it is, she is nothing to us but a slim
young lady, in white satin, walking about on the boards of a
Theatre.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> The writer of this article furthermore reminds
the public: “we shall ... always have more to say on five
minutes of genius, than on five hours of dulness.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> And&mdash;“It
would also be desirable for both parties, if our Edinburgh
readers would not forget that we write from London, and our
London ones that we write for Edinburgh.”<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> The second installment,
February 1818, of these dramatic notices, comes down to
more specific criticisms.&mdash;“Perhaps we were more disgusted
by this revived play, the Point of Honour, than we should otherwise
have been, from being obliged to sit, and see, and hear
Miss O’Neil’s delightful voice and looks cast away upon it.&mdash;Though
they have chosen to call it a play, it is one of that
herd of Gallo-Germanic monsters which have visited us of late
years, under the name of Melo-Dramas;... It makes the
ladies in the galleries and dress-boxes shed those maudlin
tears that always flow when weak nerves are over-excited.”<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>Needless to say, the whole tone of the magazine
was not of this light and popular kind. Much that it published
was heavy, some of it dry. All the preceding gives in general
the atmosphere of what ensured the success of the budding “Maga”.
It continued in this manner, but ever mingling the steady, the
serious, the grave, with the lively and the scandalous. For
instance in the number for April 1818 we find an article “On
the Poor Laws of England; and Answers to Queries Transmitted by
a Member of Parliament, with a View to Ascertaining the Scottish
System”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>,&mdash;some four pages or more of serious discussion. In
the same number appears “Letters on the Present State of Germany,
Letter I”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>, earnestly setting forth the causes of discontent
in Germany, acknowledging into the bargain, that “the triumph of
human intellect over the sway of despotism was never made more
manifest than it has been within the last fifty years among the
Germans”<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>, and concluding with a paragraph from our modern point
of view more than interesting: “If the Germans have a Revolution,
it will, I hope and trust, be calm and rational, when compared
with that of the French. Its precursors have not been, as in
France, ridicule, raillery, derision, impiety; but sober
reflection, Christian confidence, and manly resolutions, gathered
and confirmed by the experience of many sorrowful years. The
sentiment is so universally diffused&mdash;so seriously established&mdash;so
irresistible in its unity,&mdash;that I confess I should be

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
greatly delighted, but not very much astonished, to hear of
the mighty work being accomplished almost without resistance,
and entirely without outrage.”<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> This number likewise includes
an article discussing the “Effect of Farm Overseers on the
Morals of Farm Servants”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>, another called “Dialogues on Natural
Religion”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>, and a “Hospital Scene in Portugal. (Extracted from
the Journal of a British Officer, in a series of Letters to
a Friend)”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>, a graphic description which spares no horrible
detail or opportunity for the pathetic.</p>

<p>The first article in the number for May 1818 is
a brief but strictly specific “Description of the Patent Kaleidoscope,
Invented by Dr. Brewster”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>. This issue too presented
the first of a series entitled “The Craniologists Review”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>,
No. I being a description of Napoleon’s head, supposedly by “a
learned German”, a Doctor Ulric Sternstare, who may or may not
have been a <i>bona fide</i> personage. One is apt to suspect, however,
that these articles are by our young friend Lockhart.
“Maga” owed many a <i>nomme de plume</i> to Lockhart’s German travels;
the subject matter, craniology, is one of his own hobbies, as
later revealed in <i>Peter’s Letters</i>; and the last sentence is
more reminiscent of the young scamp than any “learned German”!
The article concludes: “I think him a more amiable character than
that vile toad Frederick of Prussia, who had no moral faculties
on the top of his head; and he will stand a comparison with

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>

<p>There is a gem of an article in <i>Blackwood’s</i> for
July 1818, the fourth of a series of “Letters of Timothy Tickler
to Eminent Literary Characters. Letter IV&mdash;To the Editor
of <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>”.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Timothy Tickler was an uncle of
John Wilson’s, a Mr. Robert Sym; but it is doubtful whether
Robert Sym was the author of many, if any, of the compositions
laid at the door of the venerable Timothy. This Letter IV is
professedly in answer to one from the editor of <i>Blackwood’s</i>.
Obviously it is only another device, and a clever one, to discuss
the merits of “Maga”, and make a stab at the Whigs and
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>. Old Timothy says, “You wish to have my
free and candid opinion of your work in general, and I will
now try to answer your queries in a satisfactory way. Your
Magazine is far indeed from being a ‘faultless monster, which
the world ne’er saw’; for it is full of faults, and most part of
the world has seen it.... Just go on, gradually improving
Number after Number, and you will make a fortune.”<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Seeming
criticism, then a sudden tooting of the Blackwood horn, seeming
praise of Constable, then a flash and a dig, characterize the
article throughout. He continues: “You go on to ask me what I

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
think of Constable’s Magazine? Oh! my dear Editor, you are
fishing for a compliment from old Timothy again!&mdash;I have
seen nothing at all comparable to it during the last three
score and ten years. Thank you, <i>en passant</i>, for the Numbers
of it you have sent me. Almost anything does for our minister
to read.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> He concludes thus: “I shall have an opportunity
of writing you again soon ... when I hope to amuse you with
certain old-fashioned whimsies of mine about the Whigs of
Scotland, whom I see you like no more than myself.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>This is followed by a very brief sketch of the
“Important Discovery of Extensive Veins and Rocks of Chromate
of Iron in the Shetland Islands”<a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>; and this in turn by a
“Notice of the Operations Undertaken to Determine the Figure of
the Earth, by M. Biot, of the Academy of Sciences, Paris, 1818”,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
eleven pages in length, and though decidedly statistical, discursive
and meditative enough in tone to interest more than the
merely scientific reader.</p>

<p>The less said about the poetry in <i>Blackwood’s
Magazine</i> the better. Most of it is pretty poor stuff. It is
strange, with men like Wordsworth and Coleridge and Byron
living, that “Maga” should print such feeble verse&mdash;all the
more strange when those responsible for the periodical were
such venerators of intellectual power and so ably appreciative.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
The Wordsworthian influence is largely reflected in much of
the <i>Blackwood</i> verse, in fact the Wordsworthian love for the
simple and the commonplace is reflected to such an extent that
it assumes the aspect of the commonplace run to seed. Of
course, opposition to the Cockney School was pure principle
on the part of the magazine; and no matter what fine poetry
“the Shelley’s and the Keatses” produced, “Maga” must per
necessity say nay! With the exception of some of the verse
of James Hogg, and occasional bits like the anonymous “To My
Dog”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> in the issue for January 1818, there is practically
nothing to hold one spellbound. There is a good deal of
satiric verse on the order of that by “Ensign Odoherty”,
already sampled. The first twelve volumes of the magazine
contain much lengthy and serious verse bearing the signature
Δ, whom we know to have been David M. Moir, “The amiable
Delta” of the Blackwood group. His poetry takes no hold
upon us of the present hour, but strangely enough, men like
Tennyson, Jeffrey, Lockhart, found it praiseworthy, and even
Wordsworth. It must be of some value if Wordsworth praised
it who was not often known to show interest in any poetry
but his own.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="label">151</a>
Ibid., V. ii, p. 378</p></div>

<p>The number for March 1822 began the “Noctes
Ambrosianae”<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>, which continued till February 1835<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>. These

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
papers are too well known to demand much mention here. Suffice
it to say that during their career, they were the most
popular and eagerly read feature of all periodical literature
of the time.</p>

<p>In July 1820, Lockhart reviewed Washington Irving’s
“Knickerbocker’s History of New York”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>. All mention
of such papers as “Extracts from Mr. Wastle’s Diary”, which
made its first appearance in March 1820<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>, can scarcely be
omitted. It is the Mr. Wastle of <i>Peter’s Letters</i> whom Lockhart
makes responsible for this series, which, like the compositions
of Timothy Tickler, is but another device for merry
making over local events and persons.</p>

<p>Interesting reviews of now famous books, wholesale
massacre of now worshipped men, sweeping conclusions historical
and political, among them at times such momentous verdicts
as appeared in May 1819, that “no great man can have a
small nose”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>&mdash;such marked the progress and reputation of the
magazine. Whether we feel we can exalt wholly and unreservedly
<i>Blackwood’s Edinburgh Magazine</i>, we can at least heartily
agree with Lockhart when he says: “I think the valuable
part of The Materials is so great as to furnish no inconsiderable

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
apology for the mixture of baser things.”<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Moreover, it
did more to counteract the influence of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>
than any other periodical living or dead.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

This discussion makes no pretense at finality. Treatment
herein has been cursory and suggestive, not exhaustive.
A vast and fruitful field remains untouched.</p></div>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
